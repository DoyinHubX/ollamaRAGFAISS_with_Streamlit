# Build Your Own Local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System  

Creating a local RAG system is both exciting and practical, giving you full control over your data while enhancing privacy and security. This guide walks you through building a local RAG system from scratch using **Ollama, FAISS, and Streamlit**.  

You'll learn how to ingest documents, store vector embeddings with FAISS, and efficiently query them using an LLM.  

## Key Features  

‚úÖ **Privacy & Security** ‚Äì Keep all data on your local machine, ensuring complete control.  
‚úÖ **Efficient Retrieval** ‚Äì FAISS enables fast and accurate document searches.  
‚úÖ **Interactive UI** ‚Äì Streamlit provides an intuitive way to query and visualize results.  

## How to Use  


1Ô∏è‚É£ **Clone the repository:**    

 ```sh
   git clone <repo_link>
 ```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies:

 ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the application:

  ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
 ```

4Ô∏è‚É£ Upload documents for processing and embedding.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Ask questions ‚Äì the system retrieves relevant document snippets and generates AI-powered responses.
